"uxWritingGuidelines":
"Writing Style - Dos: Use American English; Write from the user’s perspective, not the system’s; Use active voice and simple tense; Be direct, helpful, and avoid blaming the user; Use complete sentences ending with a period; Be concise; avoid long sentences; Use Title Case for titles and labels; Example: 'The Base Currency Code is required.'

Writing Style - Don'ts: Don’t end labels with a colon (:); Avoid contractions (e.g., use 'are not' instead of 'aren’t'); Avoid exclamation marks, ellipsis (...), brackets, quotation marks, and ampersand (&); Do not use UPPERCASE except for obvious abbreviations; Avoid idioms and jargon; Avoid referring to UI components explicitly; Avoid using 'please' unless asking for inconvenience or software blame.

Tone and Voice: Use business conversational language—professional but personable; Avoid addressing the user directly as 'you'; Avoid technical or coding terminology; Be direct and concise; Example: 'Restart your computer.' instead of 'You need to restart your computer.'

Grammar: Use active, simple tense; Avoid passive voice (is/are/was/were); Prefer short, clear messages; Example: 'Report created.' instead of 'Report is created.'; Use singular form in buttons (e.g., 'Copy Line'); Prioritize clarity over strict grammar in messages.

Writing Strategy: Consider context (who, when, before/after); Avoid excessive explanatory text in UI.

Translation Considerations (extra space needed by text length): 1-10: 200%, 11-20: 100%, 21-30: 80%, 31-50: 60%, 51-70: 40%, 70+: 30%

Capitalization: Use Title Case for titles, labels, and commands; Limit title case in messages to the main object.

Styling Preference: Use bold for page/field names; Use plain text if understandable; Use double quotes only if necessary.
